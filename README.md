- 👋 Hi, I’m @melohub3008, currently a second-year Computer Science UG student
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Dev and App Dev. I worked with pygame so far, and created a 2D game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to work with Unreal Engine, the basics of App Dev, and ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projects that could help me learn about App Dev and Game Dev, and expand my skillset.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a huge fan of anime (open to recommendations :) ), and also love driving.
